# Legacy Site Backup

This folder contains the original personal portfolio website for "Elif Eldemir, SMMM" that was previously hosted on this repository.

## Files
- `index.html` - Original homepage with portfolio content
- `styles.css` - Original CSS with excellent accessibility patterns (preserved in new design)
- `script.js` - Original progressive enhancement JavaScript

## What was preserved in the new TOFI marketplace:
- **Accessibility patterns**: WCAG 2.2 AA compliance, skip links, focus management
- **Design system**: CSS custom properties, responsive design, color schemes
- **Progressive enhancement**: JavaScript enhancement approach
- **Security**: CSP implementation patterns
- **Performance**: Minimal, fast-loading approach

The new TOFI marketplace builds upon these excellent foundations while providing a completely different user experience for the Swiss flower marketplace.
